Brain Tumor Data Analysis Dashboard | Power BI

💠 Project Overview

Brain tumors are among the most critical neurological conditions, requiring early diagnosis, accurate classification, and continuous monitoring for effective treatment planning.

Healthcare datasets often contain complex, unstructured, and difficult-to-interpret information, making it challenging for medical professionals and analysts to quickly identify meaningful insights.

This project focuses on building an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze brain tumor patient data and transform raw medical records into clear, visual, and actionable insights that support:

Understanding tumor distribution across brain regions

Identifying the most affected age groups

Tracking yearly diagnosis trends

Comparing confirmed vs. unconfirmed tumor cases

Supporting data-driven healthcare awareness and decision-making

💠 Data Source / Dataset

The dataset contains 680+ patient medical records related to brain tumor diagnosis and characteristics.

Key Data Fields Include:

Patient demographic details (age group, gender)

Tumor type classification

Affected brain region

Diagnosis confirmation status

Date/year of diagnosis

The data required cleaning, formatting, and transformation before analysis to ensure accuracy and usability in reporting.

💠 Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI

Power Query for data cleaning and transformation
